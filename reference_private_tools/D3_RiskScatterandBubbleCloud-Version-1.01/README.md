D3_RiskScatterandBubbleCloud
============================

This is a javascript and HTML5 code for generating a bubble scatter graph for plotting risks registers.
Risks entries come in a csv file with likelihood and impact rating (1 to 5) and various extra dimensions
(threat category, owner initials, level, RAG scoring) and those can be used to colorize or cluster.

It uses D3.JS and to a lesser degree jquery to load the JSON config file.

Still very much a proof of concept/alpha version.
