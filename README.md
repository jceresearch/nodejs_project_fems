This is a working repo setup with NodeJS and a few tooling for the IDE
specifically for javascript, not yet Typscript
E.g. 
- eslint,
- prettier,
- parcel (bundler, in future I will try vite)
- nodemon (to reload on change, works with nodejs).

This particular project takes some hardcoded data, loads into nodejs and then pushes into a d3.js viz



## How to run
  
  ```npm start  # or yarn start```
  in the terminal to run the server

```npm dev ``` 
in the terminal will run the static data directly from the html file
