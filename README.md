This is a working repo setup with NodeJS and a few tooling for the IDE
specifically for javascript, not yet Typscript
E.g. eslint, prettier, bunder (parcel, not sure it works with nodejs), nodemon 
(to reload on change, works with nodejs).

## How to run
  
  ```npm start  # or yarn start```
  in the terminal to run the server

```npm dev ``` 
in the terminal will run the static data directly from the html file
